#Simple Linear Regression
#dataset=slaries.csv

predicting the salaries of an employees based on their experiences...
saleries.csv provides the data to train the ml algorithm..
we split the data into training set and test set ..
using Linear Regression class to train the data by fitting the training data to the LinearRegression  object..
ML Algorithm finds the correleations between salaries and the years of experience..
To test the performance of our algorithm we use test set data to predict the salaries..
Atlast we plot the predicted salaries using scatterplot and draw a regression line from which we know the differences in actual salary and predicted salary..
Thats it ....
Happy Machine Learning Pals......
